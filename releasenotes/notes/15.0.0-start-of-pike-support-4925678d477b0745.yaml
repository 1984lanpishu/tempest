    This release is marking the start of Ocata release support in Tempest
other:
  - |
    OpenStack releases supported at this time are **Mitaka**, **Newton**,
    and **Ocata**.

    The release under current development as of this tag is Pike,
    meaning that every Tempest commit is also tested against master during
    the Pike cycle. However, this does not necessarily mean that using
    Tempest as of this tag will work against a Pike (or future releases)
    cloud.
